# GNMessagesTrial

I'm a beginner coder trying to figure out how to use the Google Nearby Messages SDK.

Ive followed all the steps to get it implemented but I'm gettting this error 

"UIAlertView is deprecated and unavailable for UIScene based applications, please use UIAlertController!

I'm prettry sure it's from 

 let publication =
            messageManager?.publication(with: GNSMessage(content: name.data(using: .utf8)))
            
            
            
 In TableViewController. Any help would be more than welcome.
